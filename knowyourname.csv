What began as laughter   So soon would turn to pain.      The sky was clear and frigid   The air was thick and still   Now I'm not one to soon forget   And I bet I never will      Picture for a moment   The perfect irony   A flawless new beginning   Eclipsed by tragedy.      The uninvited stranger   Started dancing on his own   So we said goodbye to the glowing bride   And we made our way back home.      Life was so simple then   We were so innocent.   Father and mother   Holding each other.   (Chug chug chug chug)      Without warning   Out of nowhere   Like a bullet   From the night      Crushing glass   Rubber and steel   Scorching fire   Glowing lights      Screams of terror   Pain of fear   Sounds of sirens   Smoke in my eyes      Sudden stillness   Wrapped in silence   No more screaming   No more cries      Stunned and bewildered   Cold and afraid   Torn up and broken   Frightened and dazed      Stunned and bewildered   Cold and afraid   Torn up and broken   Frightened and dazed      Lying on the table   In this unfamiliar place   I'm greeted by a stranger   A man without a face      He said, ""Son do you remember?   Do you even know your name?""   Then he shined a light into my eyes   And said, ""take this for the pain.""      Hopelessly drifting,   Bathing in beautiful agony.   I am endlessly falling,   Lost in this wonderful misery.      In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake   And thought of the panic inside starts to fade.   Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony.      ""Tell me does this hurt you?""   Said the faceless man.   ""Can you move all of your fingers?   Can you try your best to stand?""      I asked about the others   ""Is everyone okay?""   He told me not to worry   As he turned and looked away.      Hopelessly drifting,   Bathing in beautiful agony.   I am endlessly falling,   Lost in this wonderful misery.   In peaceful sedation, I lay half awake   And thought of the panic inside starts to fade.   Hopelessly drifting, bathing in beautiful agony.      Day after day   And night after night   We burden the oppressed   Did they ever see the red light?      Over and over   Scene by scene   Like a recurring nightmare haunting my dreams.   How could you prepare      For what would happen next?   The search you'll never have to see   Hi father such a mess.   It's a miracle he lived      It's a blessing no one died   By the grace of God above   Everyone survived      Life was so simple then   We were so innocent.   It will stay with us forever   A nightmare to remember  "
